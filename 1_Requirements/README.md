# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
* STM32 CubeIDE
# COMPONENTS:
* STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD
# DESCRIPTION:
* The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family depends on the elite execution Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-digit RISC center working at a recurrence of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 center highlights a Floating point unit (FPU) single accuracy which upholds all Arm single-accuracy information handling guidelines and information types. It likewise carries out a full arrangement of DSP guidelines and a memory insurance unit (MPU) which improves application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family consolidates rapid implanted

# Xpack Packages:
* Windows Build Tools: The xPack Windows Build Tools is a standalone Windows binary distribution of GNU make and a few of other tools required by the Eclipse Embedded CDT (formerly GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse) project, but the binaries can also be used in generic build environments.

# OpenOCD:
* Open On-Chip Debugger (OpenOCD) is a free, open-source project that aims to provide debugging, in-system programming, and boundary scan using a debug adapter. The adapter is a hardware module that provides the right signals for the target to understand.

# QEMU:
* The xPack QEMU Arm is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of QEMU, with several extensions for Arm Cortex-M devices.


# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER:
* Up to 1 Mbyte of Flash memory.
* Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.
* 512 bytes of OTP memory.
* Flexible static memory controller supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND memories.


# STRENGTH:
* Low Budget
* Increase safety
* Variable speed controls

# WEAKNESS:
* High maintenance.
* No automation

# OPPORTUNITIES:
* Can be automated .
